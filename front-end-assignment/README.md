# Complete Rommel-dk/front-end-test

  

 1. Cd into the directory **front-end-assignment**
 2. ### `npm install`
 3. ### `npm run dev` (this will start dev and json-server)

## 100% React based project
First of all thank you for giving me this opportunity.
The whole website is build with create-react-app and contains 100% functional components with react hooks. 
I have used Json-Server package for “local requesting” the data you gave me (data.json).
The assignment was fun and challenging and I hope the result pleases the requirements.
I have tried to keep my styling cross browser friendly, however I do use properties like CSS custom properties (variable) for the colors, because of the time and simplicity. 

My personal approach would be using a CSS preprocessor like Sass with the BEM methodology or maybe go with a scooping approach like CSS-Modules and of course Post-Css :)  

The article grid is made with CSS Grid and a little bit of javascript and it works perfectly, however I may consider using a finish-made library for this kind of job like Masonry.js.
I didn't go too crazy with the media query breakpoints, but just enough to make my point with the design.

I believe communication is key and at the end of the day, I will always talk to the designer and the tester as much as I can to clear things out.
